## VI. Machine Learning Approach for Heavy M_HÂ±

In the previous two sections, we underscored the efficacy of our cut-based analysis strategy
in achieving robust significance values as well as the mass reconstruction of $m_{\gamma\gamma}$ and $M_{H^\pm}$.
Yet, challenges manifested when addressing the heavy charged Higgs boson. For instance, BP-6
reached a significance of 4.09, which is not convincing enough to confirm the presence of
the very light fermiophobic Higgs boson. Hence, in this section, we employ machine learning
techniques, with a keen focus on BP-6, BP-12, and BP-18, aiming to enhance the significances.
At the parton-level, the total cross sections for these benchmarks are $\sigma_\text{tot}(\text{BP-6}) = 9.62\,\text{fb}$,
$\sigma_\text{tot}(\text{BP-12}) = 9.63\,\text{fb}$, and $\sigma_\text{tot}(\text{BP-18}) = 9.83\,\text{fb}$.

For those interested in the datasets and the detailed operation of the deep learning model, we have made them available in [diphoton_jets_cnn.ipynb](diphoton_jets_cnn.ipynb).
